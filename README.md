# School_District_Analysis
As a part of the challenge, the analysis was broken into three parts.

a. **Data Collection**
Additional data, like school budgets, were included in the analysis. Imported the new data CSV file and created a new data frame.
Confirmed that Pandas correctly imported the new data.


b. **Data Preparation**
Data Cleansing: Removed rows with missing data and duplicated rows from the data frame.
Data change in grade column: Data was stored as text, removed the suffix and later converted data to an integer type. This conversion is critical for doing any statistical/ mathematical analysis.


c. **Data Summarization**
Provided the statistical summary for the Data Frame.
The mean was calculated for the math scores and provided the minimum reading score across schools.


d. **Deep Dive into the Data**
The math and reading scores for three high schools (Sullivan, Dixon & Wagner) were highlighted.
A statistical drill down (count, min/max, mean, std. deviation, percentile data) for grade 9 was provided.
Grade 10 in Dixon High school had the lowest reading score (10.5) among all grades & schools. Other data points like math scores and the school budget for the school highlighted so that they can help in further analysis.
Mean reading math scores for all school students in grades 11 and 12 were calculated.


e. **Comparison between data Subsets ( Charter & Public Schools)** The following comparisons between data subsets were provided
Average reading and math scores for charter and public schools.
Average budgets available with the two school types
Student counts across the 14 schools were sorted in a descending manner.
Average math scores for the different grades in charter and public schools.


f. **Possible additional Analyses with the Data** 
We can derive additional insights from this Data set like
Comparison between different grades (math and reading scores).
Derive a co-relation between school budgets and grades in subjects. Further, drill down at grade level.
Plot the reading and math scores grade-wise (distribution) and look for skews.
If we have further data on school location (county/ state), population, average income & education levels, and family details - further comprehensive analysis is possible.
